If the UL RSSI level is outside of the normal boundaries of -120 and -114, check the uplink configuration and see if the pZeroNominalPucch value is close to the optimal -114 and pZeroNominalPusch is close to the optimal -100 values. Consider adjusting these configurations if they differ from the optimal by more than 5%.",
