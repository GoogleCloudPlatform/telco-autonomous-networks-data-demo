Check the uplink configuration and see if pZeroNominalPucch value is close to the optimal -114 and pZeroNominalPusch is close to the optimal -100 values. Consider adjusting these configurations if they significantly different from the optimal. If UL RSSI is between -114 and -105dbm it should be monitored to check if KPIs are affected. UL RSSI within the -120 and -114 range is considered normal. UL RSSI lower than -120dbm is considered too low - check the cell status",
